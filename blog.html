            <p>During this assignment, I faced several problems.
                One of the very first problem I faced was getting the terminal to open VSCode using "code ."
                I was able to resolve this by installing and configuring a path in VSCode.
                Another challenge I faced was getting the basics of html down in this assignment.
                I overcame this by taking notes in lecture and reveiwing the lecture notes and example code.</p>

            <p>As a result, I learned a lot of things from this assignment.
                I learned what HTML is. The basic structure every .html file have and several html tags.
                I also learned about how git and github works and how to properly make use of terminal.
                It was kind of hard to work in terminal but I am starting to get ahold of it.
            </p>

            <p>Git-it helped at the very beginnig in getting to know more about git.
                Professor Rob Hess was also a great help since it was him who helped me with the problem with opening VSCode from terminal.
