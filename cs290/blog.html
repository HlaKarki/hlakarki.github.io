            <ul>

                <li><h3>The challenges and problems I had completing this assignment</h3></li>
                <p>&emsp; During this assignment, I faced several problems.
                    One of the very first problem I faced was getting the terminal to open VSCode using "code ."
                    I was able to resolve this by installing and configuring a path in VSCode.
                    Another challenge I faced was getting the basics of html down in this assignment.
                    I overcame this by taking notes in lecture and reveiwing the lecture notes and example code.
                </p>
            
                <li><h3>Things I learned from this assignment</h3></li>
                <p>&emsp; As a result, I learned a lot of things from this assignment.
                    I learned what HTML is. The basic structure every .html file have and several html tags.
                    I also learned about how git and github works and how to properly make use of terminal.
                    It was kind of hard to work in terminal but I am starting to get ahold of it.
                </p>

                <li><h3>Resources I made use of in this assignment</h3></li>
                <p>&emsp; Git-it helped at the very beginnig in getting to know more about git.
                    Professor Rob Hess was also a great help since it was him who helped me with the problem with opening VSCode from terminal.
                    I also got a lot of help from google. For example, I learned that I could use center tags to center the text in html.
                    I also learned that "emsp;" with "&" at the front adds four spaces to my text in html
                </p>
            </ul>

            
            <h2>Assignment 2 - Styling a page with CSS | October 4th 2022 | Link to my <a href="https://hlakarki.github.io/cs290/assignment2/">Benny's List</a></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>The challenges and problems I had completing this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p>&emsp; I initially had a lot of trouble trying to figure how to display the Benny's image and the title in one line.
                        However, I was able to figure it after reviewing the lecture recording and the notes I had taken. Another thing I 
                        had trouble with was when matching the filter container. For some reason, I completely overlooked that I can use the "#id"
                        to specificially pick which form I want to edit. It was one of the multiple brain farts I had during the assignment. I was
                        able to resolve this after I talked through the problem with my classmate. One more thing that gave a headache was when I
                        was trying to align the image center to its image container. I tried many different things but none of them worked. I was
                        able to figure it out with the help of my other classmate who mentioned that I needed to change the display to block and 
                        only after that assign margin to auto. Worked perfectly after!
                    </p>
                    
                    <li><h3>Things I learned from this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p>&emsp; There are many things that I learned in this assignment. I have a really good understanding of how to position different
                        containers in many different ways now. I also learned a neat trick from my classmate regarding the posts. When working with multiple
                        containers, it really helps to assign a border with different colors to them to be able to see and understand the things that are
                        happening better. It greatly helped me. To list the things I learned; combinators, display, position, padding, margin, hover, wrap,
                        text decoration, flex, cursor, align, border radius, box shadow and transfrom to scale a button.
                    </p>
    
                    <li><h3>Resources I made use of in this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p>&emsp; I made use of the lecture videos and lecture notes a lot during this assignment. Discussions with my classmates also helped
                        a great deal. If both of these sources could not provide me with what I needed, I turned to www.w3schools.com. One more thing I made
                        use of was photopea(https://www.photopea.com/). I opened the mock whole image of the site in photopea and used the eyedropper tool to
                        copy the exact color to my site. This site a great alternative to photoshop and it's free!
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>Two things I had to Google during this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p>&emsp; Not that I had to google these because it was not taught in class, but rather because I wanted to review the topic. As
                        mentioned above, I made use of w3schools.com. I reviewed many topics from their website;
                        combinators, display, box-shadow, align, positions and margins.
