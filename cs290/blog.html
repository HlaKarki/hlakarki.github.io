                    <p class="answers">&emsp; During this assignment, I faced several problems.
                        One of the very first problem I faced was getting the terminal to open VSCode using "code ."
                        I was able to resolve this by installing and configuring a path in VSCode.
                        Another challenge I faced was getting the basics of html down in this assignment.
                        I overcame this by taking notes in lecture and reveiwing the lecture notes and example code.
                    </p>
                
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Things I learned from this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; I learned a lot of things from this assignment.
                        I learned what HTML is. The basic structure every .html file have and several html tags.
                        I also learned about how git and github works and how to properly make use of terminal.
                        It was kind of hard to work in terminal but I am starting to get ahold of it.
                    </p>
    
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Resources I made use of in this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; Git-it helped at the very beginnig in getting to know more about git.
                        Professor Rob Hess was also a great help since it was him who helped me with the problem with opening VSCode from terminal.
                        I also got a lot of help from google. For example, I learned that I could use center tags to center the text in html.
                        I also learned that "emsp;" with "&" at the front adds four spaces to my text in html
                    </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><h3 class="questions">The challenges and problems I had completing this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; I initially had a lot of trouble trying to figure how to display the Benny's image and the title in one line.
                        However, I was able to figure it after reviewing the lecture recording and the notes I had taken. Another thing I 
                        had trouble with was when matching the filter container. For some reason, I completely overlooked that I can use the "#id"
                        to specifically pick which form I want to edit. It was one of the multiple brain farts I had during the assignment. I was
                        able to resolve this after I talked through the problem with my classmate. One more thing that gave a headache was when I
                        was trying to align the image center to its image container. I tried many different things but none of them worked. I was
                        able to figure it out with the help of my other classmate who mentioned that I needed to change the display to block and 
                        only after that assign margin to auto. Worked perfectly after!
                    </p>
                        
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Things I learned from this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; There are many things that I learned in this assignment. I have a really good understanding of how to position different
                        containers in many different ways now. I also learned a neat trick from my classmate regarding the posts. When working with multiple
                        containers, it really helps to assign a border with different colors to them to be able to see and understand the things that are
                        happening better. It greatly helped me. To list the things I learned; combinators, display, position, padding, margin, hover, wrap,
                        text decoration, flex, cursor, align, border radius, box shadow and transfrom to scale a button.
                    </p>
        
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Resources I made use of in this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; I made use of the lecture videos and lecture notes a lot during this assignment. Discussions with my classmates also helped
                        a great deal. If both of these sources could not provide me with what I needed, I turned to www.w3schools.com. One more thing I made
                        use of was photopea(https://www.photopea.com/). I opened the mock whole image of the site in photopea and used the eyedropper tool to
                        copy the exact color to my site. This site a great alternative to photoshop and it's free!
                    </p>
    
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Two things I had to Google during this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; Not that I had to google these because it was not taught in class, but rather because I wanted to review the topic. As
                        mentioned above, I made use of w3schools.com. I reviewed many topics from their website;
                        combinators, display, box-shadow, align, positions and margins. One more thing I had to search for during this assignment was the scaling of
                        the update button. I was using the width and height to change the size in hover but that was doing it from the corner. So that's how i found
                        out about scaling.                   
                    </p>

                <h2 class="assignment-name">Assignment 3 - Client-side JS | October 27th 2022 | Link to my <a href="https://hlakarki.github.io/cs290/assignment3/">JS Integrated Benny's List</a></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><h3 class="questions">The challenges and problems I had completing this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; This assignment is the hardest challenge I have faced so far. Since I was not familar with how javascript worked and how 
                        the process and method of accessing html elements from javascript worked, I had to spend some time trying to test things out and figure how things
                        worked. After that, it was easier forward. The biggest problem I faced during this assignment was during the filter part. I was initially using only
                        one array which was fixed; the global state array. So, I was going through the filter from top to bottom; i.e. text, price, city, condition. With
                        too many nested if statements. So it would work when I applied only one filter but when I added another filter posts unrealed to the first filter would
                        get added to the dom. After hours of trying to work around this, it came to me that I could create another array that holds the posts that has passed
                        through the first filter and use that array and not the global state array for futher checks. Finding this solution was the best part of this assignemnt.
                        It made me very happy. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Things I learned from this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; There was a lot new things I learned in this assignemnt. Starting off with how I could unhide the modal backdrop and sell something
                        modal using .style.display="block". This was before the toggle of classList was talked about in lecture. Another great trick I learned was how I could get
                        the selected values from  radio buttons using querySelector with ("input[name={{}}]:checked").value. This made my code at least 10 lines shorter wihtout all
                        the if statements. I also learned how to create tags such as "a" tags and "span" tags and how i could use setAttribute and textContext to add href, links
                        and texts. Lastly, I learned how to remove nodes from HTMLCollection from dom using posts.firstChild and posts.removeChild along with a while loop.
                    </p>
        
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Resources I made use of in this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; I would not have been able to go through this assignemnt without google and lecture notes. Everything was brand new to me so I had a
                        hard time figuring out how to even get started on a certain problem. However, going back to resources for help and ideas was what got me out of that hole.
                        I also talked with one of the TAs and professor to discuss the problem I had with adding posts back to the dom from the global state array.

                    <p class="answers">&emsp; Two things I had to Google were how to add href and links to "a" tag and another was how to make an array from an HTMLCollection. 
                        However, these are just two things mentioned here. I had to google a lot of other things to help me get used to JS.

                    <p class="answers">&emsp; This assignment was relatively easier and lighter than other previous assignments. It was easy to go through with it and I did not
                        face many problems as well. However, I did have some difficulties trying to figure out why my index.html did not have any styling or the .js applied. It
                        eventually turned out to be an easy fix in my if statements.

                    <p class="answers">&emsp; Everything I learned in this assignment was brand-new to me. I now believe I know a little bit more about how the real life web pages
                        are working behind the scenes although I think I am still quite a ways away from being able to do those things.

                        class and he gave a solid example that was directly useable in this assignment.

                <ul>
                    <li><h3 class="questions">The challenges and problems I had completing this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; Wow. I faced A LOT of problems and challenges in this assignment. The very problem was the error that I kept having while completing
                        the first step of the assignment. I did not know that the order in which I define the handlebars.js script and my template.js mattered. I spent quite a while
                        trying to figure this out. Eventually, going back to the lecture video helped me figure this out. Second challenge I had after this was in the second step when
                        I was trying to use the partials template in the views template of postPage. I was trying to use {{#each}} in the .handlebars and in the server side code, I was
                        trying to loop through the .json file again. I had to think through every step thoroughly again to figure this out since there was not much help online as well.
                        Eventually it came to me that I just had to pass the whole .json file to be rendered and the {{#each}} would loop through everything. Last "big" challenge I faced
                        was when trying to use the single post template again in the last step. In the server side, when I was rendering it, I was just using the name of the handlebars file
                        and therefore express was completely ignoring it. I tried to find how to render a partials file but nothing proved of any help. In the end, I thought of simply just
                        putting "partials/" before the file name and it worked. I felt stupid for not having thought of this afterwards.
                    </p>
                        
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Things I learned from this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; I learned how to dynamically serve html codes so that repeated codes can be easily used again and again. This was a really new topic for me and
                        although it was hard to grasp the whole idea before completing this assignment, I defenitely have a better understanding of rendering and express handlebars after. I
                        also learned how to implement .json files and its data and serve it in my html code and templates as well.
                    </p>
        
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Resources I made use of in this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; The best resource for this assignment was the lecture video and the links provided in the engineering web page of professor Rob Hess. I also tried
                        to go to stackoverflow when I needed help but for some reason, it was not of much help at all during this assignment. The example codes from week 8 and week 9 was also
                        of great help because it helped me better visualize how the code for this assignment would look like.
                    </p>
    
                    <li><h3 class="questions">Two things I had to search on the internet for during this assignment</h3></li>
                    <p class="answers">&emsp; I occasionlly went to <a id="link" href=https://www.npmjs.com>npmjs.com</a> to read through express handlebars documentation. Like I mentioned earlier,
                        I tried to search on stackoverflow for certain problems that I faced but most tips and suggestions did not apply to this assignment. Other than that, the lecture videos and 
                        example codes were all the resources I needed for this assignment.
