                <li><h3>The challenges and problems I had completing this assignment</h3></li>
                <p>&emsp; During this assignment, I faced several problems.
                    One of the very first problem I faced was getting the terminal to open VSCode using "code ."
                    I was able to resolve this by installing and configuring a path in VSCode.
                    Another challenge I faced was getting the basics of html down in this assignment.
                    I overcame this by taking notes in lecture and reveiwing the lecture notes and example code.

                <li><h3>Things I learned from this assignment</h3></li>
                <p>&emsp; As a result, I learned a lot of things from this assignment.
                    I learned what HTML is. The basic structure every .html file have and several html tags.
                    I also learned about how git and github works and how to properly make use of terminal.
                    It was kind of hard to work in terminal but I am starting to get ahold of it.

                <li><h3>Resources I made use of in this assignment</h3></li>
                <p>&emsp; Git-it helped at the very beginnig in getting to know more about git.
                    Professor Rob Hess was also a great help since it was him who helped me with the problem with opening VSCode from terminal.
                    I also got a lot of help from google. For example, I learned that I could use center tags to center the text in html.
                    I also learned that "emsp;" with "&" at the front adds four spaces to my text in html
